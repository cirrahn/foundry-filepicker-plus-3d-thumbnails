# Filepicker+ 3d Thumbnails

A quick hack to mass-generate 3d thumbnails in Filepicker plus. Caveat emptor.

## Usage

Click the "Generate 3d Model Thumbnails" button (located to the right of the "display mode" buttons). Thumbnails are generated per-directory, and saved to your data directory as `fpp-3d-thumbnails/<path/to/3d/file>.webp`.
